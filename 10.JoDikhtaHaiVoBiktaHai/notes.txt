- let's style our app to make it more appealing. There are multiple ways to do it, using CSS, SASS, SCSS, styled-components, Bootstrap, ChakraUI, MaterialUI, Tailwind etc. And we can choose any one of them but recommended way to style our app is either styled-components or any CSS framework like Bootstrap or materialUi or Tailwind etc.
- Tailwind CSS behind the scen uses PostCSS. PostCSS is a tool to transform CSS with Javascript.
- install Tailwind as per https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/parcel and make configuration files
- we need to add .postcssrc file. parcel(bundler) will use .postcssrc config file to understand Tailwind

- tailwind provides class for every style of CSS so we can simply use it using className in JSX element
- if we use same className multiple times in same JSX element, tailwind automatically removes dupicates and make it single className
- tailwind offers dark mode inbuild, we can style dark mode for our elements using dark: keyword, simoilary we can use hover: , focus: etc.
