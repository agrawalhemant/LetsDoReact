- to make a class component, we need to make a class that extends React.Component and it should have a render method whihc will return JSX that'll be rendered on UI
- to recive the props in class component, we need to create a constructor whihc will receive the props and we also need to write super(props).
- we can use props in render method using this.props

- we can also use state variables in class components just like function components using this.state
- state is a reserved keyword in JS
- we can create multiple state variables using a single this.state object altogether while in function component we have to create them one by one using useState hook
- never try to update state variable directly, instead use this.setState method which can be used to update multiple state variables at once also
