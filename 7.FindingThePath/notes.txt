- useEffect() is called every time after component is rendered. To avoid this we pass dependency array.
- in useEffect() we have two arguments: first one is the callback function that needes to be called, and second one of dependency array. The second argument is optional here, but we are passing it as an empty array beacus if we don't pass it, useEffect will be called after every re-rendering of component. Also, we can pass state variables as elements of the dependency array, so that useEffect will only be called after re-rendering if there is any change in those stae variables.
- remember to never make our state variables or useEffect() outside of component, or inside any if-else condition or inside any loop.
