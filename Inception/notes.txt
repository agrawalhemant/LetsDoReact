- The querySelector method in JavaScript is used to select the first element within the document that matches a specified CSS selector or group of selectors. (It returns the first matching element or null if no matches are found)
- we can use createElement method to create any new element of HTML using JS.
- we can use innerText method to write text within an HTML element.
- we can use appendChild method to append one element to another element (or we can use innerHTML to write HTML inside an element).

- react can be injected in our project using CDN (https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html)
- as soon as we inject react using CDN, we get React & ReactDOM objects in our code (just write React or ReactDOM in console and see the contents of these object)
- https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js => this file has the core react code
- https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js => this file contains the code which is useful for DOM operations 
- we have these two different files because React workd on different kind of devices like, phone, browser etc. So, DOM is only used with browsers.
